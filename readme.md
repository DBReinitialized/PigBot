# PigBot, the Bleu Pigs Discord mascot
PigBot is the official Discord bot and mascot of the Bleu Pigs ScriptBuilder community

## What does PigBot do?
Well, it's simple!

### Provide useful commands/services to the Bleu Pigs community

Currently, we only have one bot: RoVer (The open-source version of the ROBLOX-Discord user verification bot). Bleu Pigs, however, was built with being a one stop shop in mind for all ScriptBuilder users. To acheive this goal, PigBot will provide a variety of commands and services from:

  - Auto Roles
  - Semi-automatic identity verification + join process (requires interaction with verification)
  - Developer Announcements (ROBLOX Devforum public section)
  - and other awesome features!

### Provide tools for Staff, allowing them to perform their jobs effectively:

Being a community leader can be difficult if your tools are limited. With PigBot, Staff get access to powerful tools which allow them to make their best possible judgement. Features include:

  - Provide an Action Log for the entire community (Highlighting Joins/Leaves, Moderation actions, Deleted messages, etc)
  - Automate the new member verification process
  - Provide administrative functionality through the bot (kick, ban commands)
  - Automatic vote ignition for Elite Pig status (takes in requirements)
  - Vote System (for voting on various actions/decisions)

### Provide APIs and Services to the ScriptBuilder community:
Because we <3 ScriptBuilders here at Bleu Pigs, we want to provide the community with powerful APIs for making their projects come to life. Some of the services we'll provide include:

  - Online Script Editor
  - Script-based Data Storage
  - Universal Cross Chat for ScriptBuilders (powered by Discord)

And the list goes on! PigBot is a continously on-going project that is built for the ScriptBuilder community. We highly encourage contributions, as any assistance to the project would be greatly appreciated.
