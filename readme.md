# PigBot, the Bleu Pigs Discord mascot
PigBot is the official Discord bot of Bleu Pigs, and also the mascot of our community.

## What does PigBot do?
Well, it's simple!

- **Provide useful commands/services to the Bleu Pigs community:**
Currently, the Bleu Pigs community only has one bot: RoVer (The ROBLOX-Discord user verification bot). This means it's a Discord Server to it's bear roots. We want to make Bleu Pigs the one top shop for all ScriptBuilder related activim ities! So, we've introduced Pig Bot. Pig Bot will provide a variety of commands and services from:
  ~ Auto Roles
  ~ Identity verification
  ~ Important Developer Announcements (ROBLOX Developer news)

- **Provide tools for Staff, allowing them to perform their jobs effectively:**
Being a community member can be difficult if only have the basic tools. With Pig Bot, Staff get supercharged as the bot will:
  ~ Provide an Action Log for the entire community (Highlighting Joins/Leaves, Moderation actions, Deleted messages, etc)
  ~ Automate the new member verification process
  ~ Provide administrative functionality through the bot (kick, ban commands)
  ~ Automatic vote ignition for Elite Pig status (takes in requirements)
  ~ Vote System (for voting on various actions/decisions)

- **Provide APIs and Services to the ScriptBuilder community:**
Because we <3 ScriptBuilders here at Bleu Pigs, we want to provide the community with powerful APIs for making their projects come to life. Several of the services we'll provide include:
  ~ Online Script Editor
  ~ Script-based Data Storage
  ~ Universal Cross Chat for ScriptBuilders (powered by Discord)

And the list goes on! PigBot is a continously on-going project that is built for the ScriptBuilder community. We highly encourage contributions, as any assistance to the project would be greatly appreciated.
